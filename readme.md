# Conversion Notes:
 
### Coordinate System
Quake uses a right-handed coordinate system while Unity uses a left-handed one. So coordinate values (X,Y,Z) have been swapped to reflect this difference.

### World Scale
UPS (units per second) is measured in Unity units (meters) and not idTech units.

### Settings
Default values are accurate and emulate Quake III Arena movement with CPM(A) physics.
